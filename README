* The irclogs Scheme system
============================

This is a project that aims to provide a software library and tools that
work on IRC log files.

The project is licenced under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later. See the
file COPYING.

** Tools included

- irc2html.sps :: Based based on irc2html.scm[0] by MJ Ray, this is a
  IRC-Log-to-HTML converter. 

  In comparison to the original tool, it additionally supports:

  - running through entire directory trees of logs, with a
    configurable tree structure (currently you have to change the code
    to configure, but it's just one line).

  - Additional log file formats can be easily added.

  However, its dependencies are more heavyweight, and I have not
  tested it on MzScheme (the original implementation platform of
  irc2html.scm), just on Ikarus Scheme.

- irclog-httpd.sps :: An experimental web server that should
  eventually provide online log searching, IRC activity overviews and
  the like.
